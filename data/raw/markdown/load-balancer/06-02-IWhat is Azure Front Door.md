Many organizations have applications they want to make available to their customers, their suppliers,
and almost certainly their users. The tricky part is making sure those applications are highly available.
In addition, they need to be able to quickly respond while being appropriately secured. Azure Front
Door provides different tiers (pricing tiers) that meet these requirements. Let's briefly review the
features and benefits of these tiers so you can determine which option best suits your requirements.

# **What is a secure, modern cloud CDN?**

A secure, modern cloud CDN provides a distributed platform of servers. This helps minimize latency
when users are accessing webpages. Historically, IT staff might have used a CDN and a web-
application firewall to control HTTP and HTTPS traffic flowing to and from target applications.

If an organization uses Azure, they might achieve these goals by implementing the products described
in the following table:

**Product**
**Description**

Azure Front Door
Enables an entry point to your apps positioned in the Microsoft global edge
network. Provides faster, more secure, and scalable access to your web
applications.

Azure Content
Delivery Network

Delivers high-bandwidth content to your users by caching their content at
strategically placed physical nodes around the world.

Azure Web
Application Firewall

Helps provide centralized, greater protection for web applications from
common exploits and vulnerabilities.

# **Azure Front Door definition**

*Azure Front Door Standard/Premium* provides the capabilities of these three products. It offers a fast,
reliable, and more secure modern cloud CDN by using the Microsoft global edge network to integrate
with intelligent threat protection. Azure Front Door resides in the edge locations and manages user
requests to your hosted applications. Users connect to your application through the Microsoft global
network. Azure Front Door then routes user requests to the fastest and most available application
backend.

Note

An *application backend* is any internet-facing service that you host, either inside or outside Azure.

The following Azure Front door tiers are available:
