Introduction
You're responsible for networking at Adatum, a new and expanding online commerce store.
Adatum has several three-tier applications that run on virtual machines (VMs) that were
migrated from on-premises datacenters. These VMs are hosted across various virtual networks.
Some of the applications are available to the public internet and others should be accessible
only to users at Adatumâ€™s main office location in Sydney.

When the applications were hosted on-premises, various hardware devices used Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) model Layer 4 load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across the
web-tier VMs and across the middle-tier VMs that perform data analysis and transformation
tasks. These Layer 4 devices were configured so that you could use remote desktop protocol to
connect to individual VMs to perform administrative tasks. The hardware devices would also
stop forwarding traffic to any VM that experienced a failure and ensured that client traffic for a
session only occurred with one VM in the back-end pool. Now that the VMs are migrated to
Azure, you would like to replicate the functionality provided by the Layer 4 hardware devices
using native Azure services. You believe you can accomplish this goal with Load Balancer.

Azure Load Balancer distributes inbound traffic across a set of VMs in a back-end pool. The
back-end pool can be made up of Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) VMs or instances in a
Virtual Machine Scale Set. You can configure how incoming traffic is distributed across the back-
end pool using load-balancing rules. You can ensure that traffic isn't directed to unresponsive
nodes using health probes.

This module explains what Azure Load Balancer does, how it works, and when you should
choose to use Load Balancer as a solution to meet your organization's needs.

adding network capacity, processors, disk resources, and RAM, you can address this traffic by
implementing load balancing. Load balancing is a process in which you distribute incoming
traffic equitably across multiple computers. A pool of computers that have lower levels of
resources often responds to traffic more effectively than a single server with higher
performance.

Azure Load Balancer is an Azure service that allows you to evenly distribute incoming network
traffic across a group of Azure VMs, or across instances in a Virtual Machine Scale Set. Load
Balancer delivers high availability and network performance in the following ways:

Load-balancing rules determine how traffic is distributed to instances that comprise the back
end.
Health probes ensure the resources in the back end are healthy and that traffic isn't directed to
unhealthy back-end instances.
You can deploy public load balancers and internal (or private) load balancers in Azure:

Public load balancers are used to load balance internet traffic to your VMs. A public load
balancer maps the public IP address and port number of incoming traffic to the private IP
address and port number of the back-end pool VMs. For example, you can spread the load of
incoming web-request traffic from the internet across multiple web servers. A public load
balancer can also provide outbound connections for VMs inside your virtual network.
An internal load balancer directs traffic to resources that are inside a virtual network or that use
a VPN to access Azure infrastructure. Internal load balancer front-end IP addresses and virtual
networks are never directly exposed to an internet endpoint. Internal line-of-business (LOB)
applications run in Azure and are accessed from within Azure or from on-premises resources. An
internal load balancer is used where private IPs are needed at the front end only. Internal load
balancers are often used to balance traffic from the front-end web tier infrastructure as a
service (IaaS) VMs across a set of secondary VMs that perform tasks such as performing
calculations or data processing.
An internal load balancer enables the following types of load balancing:

Within a virtual network: Load balancing from VMs in the virtual network to a set of VMs that
reside within the same virtual network.
For a cross-premises virtual network: Load balancing from on-premises computers to a set of
VMs that reside within the same virtual network.
For multi-tier applications: Load balancing for internet-facing multi-tier applications where the
back-end tiers aren't internet-facing. The back-end tiers require traffic load balancing from the
internet-facing tier.
For LOB applications: Load balancing for LOB applications that are hosted in Azure without
added load balancer hardware or software. This scenario includes on-premises servers that are
in the set of computers whose traffic is load balanced.
Each Load Balancer type can be used for inbound and outbound scenarios and scale up to
millions of TCP and UDP application flows.

How Azure Load Balancer works
Azure Load Balancer operates at the transport layer of the OSI model. This Layer 4 functionality
allows traffic management based on specific properties of the traffic. Properties including,
source and destination address, TCP or UDP protocol type, and port number.

Load Balancer has several elements that work together to ensure an application's high
availability and performance:

Front-end IP
Load balancer rules
Back-end pool
Health probes
Inbound NAT rules
High availability ports
Outbound rules
Front-end IP
The front-end IP address is the address clients use to connect to your web application. A front-
end IP address can be either a public or a private IP address. Azure load balancers can have
multiple front-end IPs. The selection of a public or a private IP address determines which type of
load balancer to create:

Public IP address: A public load balancer: A public load balancer maps the public IP and port of
incoming traffic to the private IP and port of the VM. You can distribute specific types of traffic
across multiple VMs or services by applying load-balancing rules. For example, you can spread
the load of web request traffic across multiple web servers. The load balancer maps the
response traffic from the private IP and port of the VM to the public IP and port of the load
balancer. Then, it transmits the response back to the requesting client.

Private IP address: An internal load balancer: An internal load balancer distributes traffic to
resources that are inside a virtual network. Azure restricts access to the front-end IP addresses
of a virtual network that are load balanced. Front-end IP addresses and virtual networks are
never directly exposed to an internet endpoint. Internal line-of-business applications run in
Azure and are accessed from within Azure or from on-premises resources through a VPN or
ExpressRoute connection.

Diagram that depicts how public and internal load balancers work in Azure Load Balancer.

Load Balancer rules
A load balancer rule defines how traffic is distributed to the back-end pool. The rule maps a
given front-end IP and port combination to a set of back-end IP addresses and port combination.

Diagram that depicts how load balancer rules work in Azure Load Balancer.

Traffic is managed using a five-tuple hash made from the following elements:

---
*Page 4*

Tuesday, November 2, 2021
4

Source IP: The IP address of the requesting client.
Source port: The port of the requesting client.
Destination IP: The destination IP address of the request.
Destination port: The destination port of the request.
Protocol type: The specified protocol type, TCP or UDP.
Session affinity: Ensures that the same pool node always handles traffic for a client.
Load Balancer allows you to load balance services on multiple ports, multiple IP addresses, or
both. You can configure different load balancing rules for each front-end IP. Multiple front-end
configurations are only supported with IaaS VMs.

Load Balancer can't apply different rules based on internal traffic content because it operates at
Layer 4 (transport layer) of the OSI model. If you need to manage traffic based on its Layer 7
(application layer) properties, you need to deploy a solution like Azure Application Gateway.

Back-end pool
The back-end pool is a group of VMs or instances in a Virtual Machine Scale Set that responds to
the incoming request. To scale cost-effectively to meet high volumes of incoming traffic,
computing guidelines generally recommend adding more instances to the back-end pool.

Load Balancer implements automatic reconfiguration to redistribute load across the altered
number of instances when you scale instances up or down. For example, if you added two more
VMs instances to the back-end pool, Load Balancer would reconfigure itself to start balancing
traffic to those instances based on the already configured load balancing rules.

Health probes
A health probe is used to determine the health status of the instances in the back-end pool. This
health probe determines if an instance is healthy and can receive traffic. You can define the
unhealthy threshold for your health probes. When a probe fails to respond, the load balancer
stops sending new connections to the unhealthy instances. A probe failure doesn't affect
existing connections. The connection continues until:

The application ends the flow.
Idle timeout occurs.
The VM shuts down.
Load Balancer allows you to configure different health probe types for endpoints: TCP, HTTP,
and HTTPS.

TCP custom probe: This probe relies on establishing a successful TCP session to a defined probe
port. If the specified listener on the VM exists, the probe succeeds. If the connection is refused,
the probe fails. You can specify the Port, Interval, and Unhealthy threshold.
HTTP or HTTPS custom probe: The load balancer regularly probes your endpoint (every 15
seconds, by default). The instance is healthy if it responds with an HTTP 200 within the timeout
period (default of 31 seconds). Any status other than HTTP 200 causes the probe to fail. You can

---
*Page 5*

Tuesday, November 2, 2021

specify the port (Port), the URI for requesting the health status from the back end (URI), amount
of time between probe attempts (Interval), and the number of failures that must occur for the
instance to be considered unhealthy (Unhealthy threshold).
Session persistence
By default, Load Balancer distributes network traffic equally among multiple VM instances. It
provides stickiness only within a transport session. Session persistence specifies how traffic from
a client should be handled. The default behavior (None) is that any healthy VM can handle
successive requests from a client.

Session persistence is also known as session affinity, source IP affinity, or client IP affinity. This
distribution mode uses a two-tuple (source IP and destination IP) or three-tuple (source IP,
destination IP, and protocol type) hash to route to back-end instances. When you use session
persistence, connections from the same client go to the same back-end instance within the
back-end pool. You can configure one of the following session persistence options:

None (default): Specifies that any healthy VM can handle the request.
Client IP (2-tuple): Specifies that the same back-end instance can handle successive requests
from the same client IP address.
Client IP and protocol (3-tuple): Specifies that the same back-end instance can handle successive
requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination.
You can change this behavior by configuring one of the options that are described in the
following sections.

High availability ports
A load balancer rule configured with protocol - all and port - 0 is called a high availability (HA)
port rule. This rule enables a single rule to load balance all TCP and UDP flows that arrive on all
ports of an internal standard load balancer.

The load-balancing decision is made per flow. This action is based on the following five-tuple
connection:

Source IP address
Source port
Destination IP address
Destination port
Protocol
HA ports load-balancing rules help you with critical scenarios, such as high availability and scale
for network virtual appliances (NVAs) inside virtual networks. The feature can help when a large
number of ports must be load balanced.

Diagram that shows how high availability ports work in Azure Load Balancer.

Inbound NAT rules

---
*Page 6*

Tuesday, November 2, 2021

You can use load balancing rules in combination with Network Address Translation (NAT) rules.
For example, you could use NAT from the load balancer's public address to TCP 3389 on a
specific VM. This rule combination allows remote desktop access from outside of Azure.

Diagram that shows how inbound NAT rules work in Azure Load Balancer.

Outbound rules
An outbound rule configures Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) for all VMs or
instances identified by the back-end pool. This rule enables instances in the back end to
communicate (outbound) to the internet or other public endpoints.

When to use Azure Load Balancer
Azure Load Balancer is best suited for applications that require ultra-low latency and high
performance. Load Balancer is suitable for your organization's needs because you're replacing
existing network hardware devices that load balance traffic across applications. The applications
used multiple VM tiers when the applications were on-premises with an Azure service that has
the same functionality.

Because Load Balancer operates at Layer 4 like hardware devices that were used on-premises
before the organization migrated to Azure, you can use Load Balancer to replicate that
hardware device functionality. This functionality includes using health probes to ensure that
Load Balancer doesn't forward traffic to failed VM nodes. It also includes using session
persistence to ensure that clients only communicate with a single VM during a session.

You can configure public load balancers for front-end traffic to web tiers of applications. You can
also configure internal load balancers to balance traffic between the web tier and the tier that
performs data analysis and transformation tasks.

You can configure inbound NAT rules to allow remote desktop protocol access to a VM instance
to perform administrative tasks.

When not to use Azure Load Balancer
Azure Load Balancer isn't appropriate if you have a web application that doesn't require load
balancing running on a single IaaS VM instance. For example, if your web application only
receives a small amount of traffic and the existing infrastructure already competently deals with
the existing load, there's no need to deploy a back-end pool of VMs and no need to use Load
Balancer.

Azure provides other load-balancing solutions as alternatives to Azure Load Balancer, including
Azure Front Door, Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure Application Gateway:

Azure Front Door is an application-delivery network that provides a global load balancing and
site acceleration service for web applications. It offers Layer 7 capabilities for your application
like TLS/SSL offload, path-based routing, fast failover, a web application firewall, and caching to

*Page 7*

improve performance and high availability of your applications. Choose this option in scenarios
such as load balancing a web app deployed across multiple Azure regions.
Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that allows you to distribute traffic
optimally to services across global Azure regions while providing high availability and
responsiveness. Because Traffic Manager is a DNS-based load-balancing service, it load balances
only at the domain level. For that reason, it can't fail over as quickly as Front Door, because of
common challenges around DNS caching and systems not honoring DNS TTLs.
Azure Application Gateway provides Application Delivery Controller (ADC) as a service, offering
various Layer 7 load-balancing capabilities. Use it to optimize web farm productivity by
offloading CPU-intensive TLS/SSL termination to the gateway. Application Gateway works within
a region rather than globally.
Azure Load Balancer is a high-performance, ultra-low-latency Layer 4 load-balancing service
(inbound and outbound) for all UDP and TCP protocols. Its built to handle millions of requests
per second while ensuring your solution is highly available. Azure Load Balancer is zone-
redundant, ensuring high availability across availability zones. If Adatum had applications that
required web application firewall functionality, Azure Load Balancer wouldn't be an appropriate
solution for the company.

Imagine yourself in the role of a network engineer at an organization that is migrating to Azure.
As the network engineer you need to ensure line-of-business applications, services, and data are
available to end users of your corporate network whenever and wherever possible. You also
need to ensure users get access to those network resources in an efficient and timely manner.

Azure provides different flavors of load balancing services that help with the distribution of
workloads across your networks. The aim of load balancing is to optimize the use of your
resources, while maximizing throughput and minimizing the time it takes for a response. You
can create internal and public load balancers in an Azure environment to distribute the network
traffic within your network and the network traffic arriving from outside your network. In this
module, you learn about using the Azure Load Balancer, and Traffic Manager load balancing
services.

Explore load balancing
The term load balancing refers to the even distribution of incoming network workloads to a
group of backend computing resources or servers. Load balancing aims to optimize resource
use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overloading any single resource.
Load balancing can also improve availability by sharing a workload across redundant computing
resources.

This video reviews how to select a load balancing solution.

Load Balancing options for Azure
Azure provides various load balancing services that you can use to distribute your workloads
across multiple computing resources, but the following are the main services:

Azure Load Balancer. High-performance, ultra-low-latency Layer 4 load-balancing service
(inbound and outbound) for all UDP and TCP protocols. The load balancer can handle millions of
requests per second ensuring your solution is highly available. Azure Load Balancer is zone-
redundant, ensuring high availability across availability zones.
Traffic Manager. DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally
to services across global Azure regions, while providing high availability and responsiveness.
Because Traffic Manager is a DNS-based load-balancing service, it load-balances only at the
domain level. For that reason, it can't fail over as quickly as Front Door.
Azure Application Gateway. Provides application delivery controller (ADC) as a service, offering
various Layer 7 load-balancing capabilities. Use it to optimize web farm productivity by
offloading CPU-intensive SSL termination to the gateway.
Azure Front Door. Application delivery network that provides global load balancing and site
acceleration service for web applications. It offers Layer 7 capabilities for your application. Front
Door includes SSL offload, path-based routing, fast failover, and caching.
Categorizing load balancing services
Load balancing services can be categorized in two ways: global versus regional, and HTTP(S)
versus non-HTTP(S).

Global versus regional
Global load-balancing services distribute traffic across regional backends, clouds, or hybrid on-
premises services. These services route end-user traffic to the closest available backend. They
also react to changes in service reliability or performance. You can think of them as systems that
load balance between application stamps, endpoints, or scale-units hosted across different
regions/geographies.

In contrast, Regional load-balancing services distribute traffic within virtual networks across
virtual machines (VMs) or zonal and zone-redundant service endpoints within a region. You can

---
*Page 9*

think of them as systems that load balance between VMs, containers, or clusters within a region
in a virtual network.

HTTP(S) versus non-HTTP(S)
HTTP(S) load-balancing services are Layer 7 load balancers that only accept HTTP(S) traffic.
They're intended for web applications or other HTTP(S) endpoints. They include features such as
SSL offload, web application firewall, path-based load balancing, and session affinity.

In contrast, non-HTTP(S) load-balancing services can handle non-HTTP(S) traffic and are
recommended for nonweb workloads.

Important

In this module, we're focusing on the non-HTTP(S) solutions.

Choosing a load balancing option for Azure
Here are the key factors to decide on a load balancing option.

Type of traffic - is it for a web application? Is it a public-facing or private application?
Scope - do you need to load balance virtual machines and containers within a virtual network, or
load balance across regions, or both?
Availability - what is the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the service?
Cost - In addition to the cost of the actual service itself, consider the operational cost to manage
and maintain a solution built on that service. See Load balancing pricing.
Features and limitations - what features and benefits does each service provide, and what are
its limitations? See Load balancer limits.

an interactive way to select a load balancing solution.

Design and implement Azure load balancer using the Azure portal
Azure Load Balancer operates at layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It's
the single point of contact for clients. Azure Load Balancer distributes inbound flows that arrive
at the load balancer's front end to backend pool instances. These flows are according to
configured load-balancing rules and health probes. The backend pool instances can be Azure
Virtual Machines or instances in a virtual machine scale set.

This video reviews how to select a load balancer type.

Choosing a load balancer type
Load balancers can be public (external) or internal (private).

A public load balancer can provide outbound connections for virtual machines (VMs) inside your
virtual network. These connections are accomplished by translating their private IP addresses to
public IP addresses. External load balancers are used to distribute client traffic from the internet
across your VMs. That internet traffic might come from web browsers, module apps, or other
sources.

An internal load balancer is used where private IPs are needed at the frontend only. Internal
load balancers are used to load balance traffic from internal Azure resources to other Azure
resources inside a virtual network. A load balancer frontend can also be accessed from an on-
premises network in a hybrid scenario.

This diagram shows how public and internal load balancers can work together.

Diagram that shows a public and internal load balancer.

Azure load balancer and availability zones
Azure Load Balancer supports availability zones scenarios. A Load Balancer can either be zone
redundant, zonal, or nonzonal.

Zone redundant
Diagram that shows Zone redundant load balancers in Azure.

In a region with Availability Zones, a Standard Load Balancer can be zone-redundant. A single
frontend IP address survives zone failure. The frontend IP can be used to reach all
(nonimpacted) backend pool members no matter the zone. One or more availability zones can
fail and the data path survives as long as one zone in the region remains healthy.

---
*Page 11*

Tuesday, November 2, 2021

Zonal
Diagram that shows Zonal load balancers in Azure.

You can choose to have a frontend guaranteed to a single zone, which is known as a zonal. With
this scenario, a single zone in a region serves all inbound or outbound flow. Your frontend
shares fate with the health of the zone. The data path is unaffected by failures in zones other
than where it was guaranteed.

Nonzonal
Load Balancers can also use a "no-zone" frontend. In these scenarios, a public load balancer
would use a public IP or public IP prefix, an internal load balancer would use a private IP. This
option doesn't give a guarantee of redundancy.

Selecting an Azure load balancer SKU
There are several load balancer SKUs: Basic, Standard, and Gateway. These SKUs differ in terms
of their scenario scope and scale, features, and cost. The Gateway Load Balancer SKU is for high
performance and high availability scenarios with Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs). This table
compares the Standard and Basic Load Balancer.

important point to understand is that Traffic Manager works at the DNS level which is at the
Application layer (Layer-7).

This video reviews Traffic Manager features and how the service works.

Key features of Traffic Manager
Traffic Manager offers the several key features.

Feature
Description
Increase application availability
Traffic Manager delivers high availability for your critical
applications by monitoring your endpoints and providing automatic failover when an endpoint
goes down.
Improve application performance
Azure allows you to run cloud services and websites in
datacenters located around the world. Traffic Manager can improve the responsiveness of your
website by directing traffic to the endpoint with the lowest latency.
Service maintenance without downtime
You can plan maintenance on your applications
without downtime. Traffic Manager can direct traffic to alternative endpoints while the
maintenance is in progress.
Combine hybrid applications Traffic Manager supports external, non-Azure endpoints enabling it
to be used with hybrid cloud and on-premises deployments, including the burst-to-cloud,
migrate-to-cloud, and failover-to-cloud scenarios.
Distribute traffic for complex deployments Using nested Traffic Manager profiles, multiple
traffic-routing methods are combined to create sophisticated and flexible rules to scale to the
needs of larger, more complex deployments.
How Traffic Manager works
Azure Traffic Manager enables you to control how network traffic is distributed to application
deployments (endpoints) running in your different datacenters. Azure Traffic Manager uses DNS
to direct the client requests to the appropriate service endpoint based on a traffic-routing
method. For any profile, Traffic Manager applies the traffic-routing method associated to it to
each DNS query it receives. The traffic-routing method determines which endpoint is returned
in the DNS response.

Azure Traffic Manager supports different traffic-routing methods to determine how to route
network traffic to the various service endpoints. You select the method that best fits your
requirements.

This video reviews Traffic Manager routing methods.

Priority routing method
Use the priority routing method for a primary service endpoint for all traffic. You can provide
multiple backup endpoints in case the primary or one of the backup endpoints is unavailable.

Weighted routing method
Use the Weighted routing method when you want to distribute traffic across a set of endpoints
based on their importance. Set the weight the same to distribute evenly across all endpoints.

Performance routing method
Use the Performance routing method when endpoints are in different geographic locations.
Users should use the "closest" endpoint for the lowest network latency.

Design Azure Application Gateway

The Azure Application Gateway processes network traffic to web apps hosted on a pool of web
servers. The processing performed by Azure Application Gateway includes load balancing HTTP
traffic and inspecting traffic using a web application firewall. This type of routing is known as
application layer (OSI layer 7) load balancing. Azure Application Gateway includes the following
features:

Support for the HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2, and WebSocket protocols.
A web application firewall (WAF) to protect against web application vulnerabilities.
End-to-end request encryption.
Autoscaling to dynamically adjust capacity as your web traffic load change.
Connection draining allowing graceful removal of backend pool members during planned service
updates.
Session stickiness to ensure client requests in the same session are routed to the same backend
server.
Path and URL based routing.
How Azure Application Gateway works

Let's review the Azure Application Gateway components.

Front-end IP address. Client requests are received through a front-end IP address. You can
configure the Application Gateway to have a public IP address, a private IP address, or both.
Listeners. A listener is a logical entity that checks for incoming connection requests. A listener
accepts a request if the protocol, port, hostname, and IP address match the listener's
configuration. You must have at least one listener.
Request routing rules. A request routing rule is a key component of an application gateway
because it determines how to route traffic on the listener. The rule binds the listener, the

---
*Page 16*

Tuesday, November 2, 2021
16

backend server pool, and the backend HTTP settings. When a listener accepts a request, the
request routing rule forwards the request to the backend or redirects it elsewhere. If the
request is forwarded to the backend, the request routing rule defines which backend server
pool to forward it to.
Backend pools. A backend pool is a collection of web servers. Backend targets can include: a
fixed set of virtual machines, a virtual machine scale-set, an app hosted by Azure App Services,
or a collection of on-premises servers. The backend pool receives and processes requests.
Health probes. Health probes determine which servers are available for load-balancing in a
backend pool. Servers are automatically added and removed from the backend pool based on
their availability.

Routing configuration
One of the most important gateway configuration settings is the routing rules. The Azure
Application Gateway has two primary methods of routing client requests: path-based and
multiple sites.

Path-based routing
Path-based routing sends requests with different URL paths to different pools of back-end
servers. For example, you could direct video requests to a back-end pool optimized to handle
video streaming. You could also direct image requests to a pool of servers that handles image
retrieval.

Diagram that depicts path-based routing in Azure Application Gateway.

Multiple site routings
Multiple site routing configures more than one web application on the same Application
Gateway instance. In a multiple site configuration, you register multiple DNS names (CNAMEs)
for the IP address of the application gateway, specifying the name of each site. Application
Gateway uses separate listeners to wait for requests for each site. Each listener passes the
request to a different rule, which can route the requests to servers in a different back-end pool.
For example, you could direct all requests for http://contoso.com to a specific backend pool.

Diagram that depicts multi-site routing in Azure Application Gateway.

This video reviews the routing methods.

Other routing capabilities
Along with path-based routing and multiple site hosting, there are a few other capabilities when
routing with Application Gateway.

Redirection. Redirection can be used to another site, or from HTTP to HTTPS. For example,
redirecting HTTP requests to a secure HTTPS shopping site.
Rewrite HTTP headers. HTTP headers allow the client and server to pass additional information
with the request or the response.
Custom error pages. Application Gateway allows you to create custom error pages instead of
displaying default error pages. You can use your own branding and layout using a custom error
page.

Azure Front Door usage cases
Diagram of the Azure Front Door architecture.

This diagram shows a user request processed by Azure Front Door.

A user is requesting www.contoso.com. This request is routed from the client to Azure Front
Door. Azure Front Door resides at the edge of the Microsoft Global Network. In Azure, an edge
location is a data center that's geographically closer to end-users than traditional Azure regions.
These locations are designed to cache content and deliver services with lower latency,
improving the speed and responsiveness of applications for users worldwide.
Azure Front Door determines where to direct the client request. The routing process includes
the web application firewall, routing rules, rules engine, and caching configuration.
A nonspecific request can be routed to any one of the three regions.
A search request can be routed to a specific region optimized for search.
A request can even be routed to a region with another cloud service.
Other things to know
Routing algorithm. The Azure Front Door routing algorithm first matches based on HTTP
protocol, then frontend host, then the Path.
HTTP Protocols (HTTP/HTTPS)
Hosts (for example, www.foo.com, *.bar.com)
Paths (for example, /, /users/, /file.gif)

Response codes. Azure Front Door response codes help clients understand the purpose of the
redirect. You can set the protocol used for redirection. The most common use case of the
redirect feature is to set HTTP to HTTPS redirection.
Health probes. Front Door periodically sends a synthetic HTTP/HTTPS request to each of your
configured backends. Front Door then uses these responses from the probe to determine the
"best" backend resources to route your client requests.
Tip

What is Azure Front Door?
Many organizations have applications they want to make available to their customers, their
suppliers, and almost certainly their users. The tricky part is making sure those applications are
highly available. In addition, they need to be able to quickly respond while being appropriately
secured. Azure Front Door provides different tiers (pricing tiers) that meet these requirements.
Let's briefly review the features and benefits of these tiers so you can determine which option
best suits your requirements.

What is a secure, modern cloud CDN?
A secure, modern cloud CDN provides a distributed platform of servers. This helps minimize
latency when users are accessing webpages. Historically, IT staff might have used a CDN and a
web-application firewall to control HTTP and HTTPS traffic flowing to and from target
applications.

If an organization uses Azure, they might achieve these goals by implementing the products
described in the following table:

Product
Description
Azure Front Door
Enables an entry point to your apps positioned in the Microsoft global
edge network. Provides faster, more secure, and scalable access to your web applications.
Azure Content Delivery Network
Delivers high-bandwidth content to your users by caching
their content at strategically placed physical nodes around the world.
Azure Web Application Firewall
Helps provide centralized, greater protection for web
applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities.
Azure Front Door definition
Azure Front Door Standard/Premium provides the capabilities of these three products. It offers
a fast, reliable, and more secure modern cloud CDN by using the Microsoft global edge network
to integrate with intelligent threat protection. Azure Front Door resides in the edge locations
and manages user requests to your hosted applications. Users connect to your application
through the Microsoft global network. Azure Front Door then routes user requests to the fastest
and most available application backend.

Note

An application backend is any internet-facing service that you host, either inside or outside
Azure.

The following Azure Front door tiers are available:

Azure Front Door (classic), which is the entry level. Existing Azure customers often bolster these
features with Azure Content Delivery Network, and Azure Web Application Firewall.
Azure Front Door Standard, which is optimized for seamless content delivery.
Azure Front Door Premium, which is optimized for improved security.
Let's examine these last two tiers in more detail.

Azure Front Door Standard
Azure Front Door Standard provides the capabilities of Azure Front Door (Classic), Azure Content
Delivery Network, and Azure Web Application Firewall. Azure Front Door Standard includes:

Content-delivery optimization
Static and dynamic content acceleration
Global load balancing
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) offload
Domain and certificate management
Enhanced traffic analytics
Basic security capabilities
Azure Front Door Premium
Azure Front Door Premium provides the same capabilities as Azure Front Door Standard.
However, it's security optimized and includes the following extra features:

Extensive security capabilities across Web Application Firewall
Private link support
Integration with Microsoft Threat Intelligence and security analytics
How to improve your cloud app delivery
To improve your cloud application delivery, consider deploying an Azure Front Door solution
that best fits your needs. In the following unit, we discuss these choices in more detail.

How Azure Front Door works
In this unit, you learn how Azure Front Door works and how it:

Helps provide fast, secure, and scalable access to your web applications.
Helps protect your cloud-based apps.
Provides high-bandwidth content.
Azure Front Door optimizes access times to content. In the following diagram, users are
connecting to content hosted in the custom domain contoso.com. Azure Front Door is
implemented at multiple edge locations. Azure Front Door provides CDN features that optimize
access to backend content, while the firewall helps to secure that access.

How Azure Front Door optimizes content delivery
Azure Front Door uses the anycast protocol with split TCP at layer 7 to route HTTP/S client
requests to the most available and fastest application backend. The way Azure Front Door
routes requests depend on the routing method you select and on backend health. Azure Front
Door supports four routing methods, as the following table describes:

Routing method
Description
Latency
Helps ensure requests are sent to the lowest latency backends, within an
acceptable sensitivity range.
Priority
Uses administrator-assigned priorities to your backends when you want to
configure a primary backend to service all traffic.
Weighted
Uses administrator-assigned weights to your backends when you want to
distribute traffic across a set of backends.
Session Affinity
Allows you to configure session affinity for your frontend hosts or
domains. This helps ensure requests from the same end user are sent to the same backend.
Azure Front Door also provides backend health monitoring options. Azure Front Door
periodically assesses the health of each of your configured backends. Responses from these
backends enable Azure Front Door to determine to which backend resources your client
requests can be routed.

Note

Azure Front Door is resilient to failures, including failures of an entire Azure region due to the
many edge locations strategically placed around the world.

A CDN is a distributed collection of web servers. These servers deliver web-based content to
users. To help minimize latency, CDN's use point-of-presence locations that are next to users to
cache content.

Azure Front Door provides the following key CDN features:

Dynamic site acceleration
CDN caching rules
HTTPS custom domain support
Azure diagnostics logs
File compression
Geo-filtering
How Azure Front Door helps secure content
Azure Front Door provides web-application firewall capabilities to help protect your web
applications from exploits and vulnerabilities. Managing security for your applications can be
challenging because web applications are increasingly targeted.

Azure Front Door operates at the network's edge, close to potential attacks. This helps prevent
attacks before they can enter your network. Azure Front Door's web application firewall is based
on policies you can associate with one or more instances of Azure Front Door. These firewall
policies consist of:

Managed rule sets, which are a collection of preconfigured rules.
Custom rules that you can configure.
Note

If present, custom rules are processed first.

A rule consists of:

A condition, which determines whether a rule applies to traffic.
A priority, which determines the order in which a rule gets processed, based on importance.
An action, which can be Allow, Block, Log, or Redirect.
A mode, which there are two:
Detection: Azure Web Application Firewall only monitors and logs when in this mode. However,
it takes no other action.
Prevention: Azure Web Application Firewall takes the defined action while in this mode.
In the next unit, let's consider the factors that will help you determine which Azure Front Door
tier is most appropriate for your organizational needs.

When to use Azure Front Door
Now we discuss how to determine which Azure Front Door SKU is the best choice for your
needs. Your organization wants to provide efficient, reliable, and optimized access to application
content that's hosted in Azure. We review the following criteria:

Scalability
Security
Pricing
Content delivery
It's also important to consider several other Azure products you could use instead of Azure
Front Door, including:

Azure Traffic Manager: Provides DNS-based global routing. However, it doesn't provide for
Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol termination, or SSL offload, per-HTTP/HTTPS request, or
application-layer processing.
Azure Application Gateway: Can load-balance between your servers in a region at the
application layer.
