    "  * **Session ID & Hashing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `_generate_session_id()` → timestamp-based IDs (`session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`).\n",

    "  * **Chunk Persistence** (`save_chunks` / `load_chunks`):\n",

    "    * `save_chunks()` serializes chunks + metadata to both JSON (human-readable) and pickle (fast-load), returning the session ID.\n",

    "\n",
    "    * `save_search_index()` pickles the inverted index and stats alongside chunk metadata.\n",
    "    * `load_search_index()` retrieves the index pickle and returns it with its metadata.\n",
    "  * **Session Management** (`list_saved_sessions` / `cleanup_old_sessions`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `list_saved_sessions()` scans for `*_chunks.json`, reads metadata, and reports which sessions have pickle/index files.\n",
    "    * `cleanup_old_sessions(keep_latest)` sorts sessions by creation time, deletes all but the most recent N, and logs each removal.\n",
    "  * **Test Harness** at the end exercises storage of test chunks, loading them back, integration with `BasicTextSearcher`, and session listing.\n",
